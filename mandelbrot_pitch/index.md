## The Problem with Math...

- Far to many people preceive math as being an unappealing subject
- There are a variety of reasons for this preception
    - They find it boring or monotonous
    - Lacks emotional appeal
    - Difficult to understand
- Observe this equasion below

$$f(Z_{n+1}) = Z_{n}^2 + C$$

- Nothing exciting here, right? But...

## ...doesn't have to be a problem

## The good things about math

- As we see, not all math has to be boring or unattractive
- Math can be
    - Creative
    - Beautiful
    - Interactive
    - Dare I say even interesting?
- Is math hard? It can be at times, but maybe with the proper motivation others can be convinced that it's worth the effort.
- Math can even be useful every day, if someone is equiped to see the role it plays in our lives every day. Math plays a role in the form of things we see every day.
    - The arrangement of the seeds of a sunflower
    - The shape of a snowflake
    - Even the way a tree branches can be explained using math
